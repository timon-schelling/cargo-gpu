//! This module deals with target specs, which are json metadata files that need to be passed to
//! rustc to add foreign targets such as `spirv_unknown_vulkan1.2`.
//!
//! There are 4 version ranges of `rustc_codegen_spirv` and they all need different handling of
//! their target specs:
//! * "ancient" versions such as 0.9.0 or earlier do not need target specs, just passing the target
//!   string (`spirv-unknown-vulkan1.2`) directly is sufficient. We still prep target-specs for them
//!   like the "legacy" variant below, spirv-builder
//!   [will just ignore it](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/rust-gpu/blob/369122e1703c0c32d3d46f46fa11ccf12667af03/crates/spirv-builder/src/lib.rs#L987)
//! * "legacy" versions require target specs to compile, which is a requirement introduced by some
//!   rustc version. Back then it was decided that cargo gpu would ship them, as they'd probably
//!   never change, right? So now we're stuck with having to ship these "legacy" target specs with
//!   cargo gpu *forever*. These are the symbol `legacy_target_specs::TARGET_SPECS`, with
//!   `legacy_target_specs` being a **fixed** version of `rustc_codegen_spirv-target-specs`,
//!   which must **never** update.
//! * As of [PR 256](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/rust-gpu/pull/256), `rustc_codegen_spirv` now has
//!   a direct dependency on `rustc_codegen_spirv-target-specs`, allowing cargo gpu to pull the
//!   required target specs directly from that dependency. At this point, the target specs are
//!   still the same as the legacy target specs.
//! * The [edition 2024 PR](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/rust-gpu/pull/249) must update the
//!   target specs to comply with newly added validation within rustc. This is why the new system
//!   was implemented, so we can support both old and new target specs without having to worry
//!   which version of cargo gpu you are using. It'll "just work".
